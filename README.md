# IF - ELSE with JS

## SAMPLE CASE
A teacher is checking a student's exam and will give a score desc from A-E with the following conditions:
* Score 80 - 100: A 
* Score 70 - 79: B 
* Score 50 - 69: C 
* Score 35 - 49: D 
* Score 0 - 34: E

Make an algorithm and implementation in javascript for the following cases

```
//inputs:
let name = 'Ardian'
let score = 100

//expected output
name: Ardian; score: A
```


# TERNARY OPERATOR with JS
A teacher inputs student scores with the following 2 conditions:
* Score 100 = score inputed
* Score > 100 = score invalid

```
//inputs:
let score = 110

//expected output
score: invalid
```


## CONCLUSION
* ternary = only 2 conditions
* if-else = can be more than 2 conditions
